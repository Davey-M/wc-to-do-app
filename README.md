# Weekend Challenge To Do App

## Description

_Duration: 2.5 Days_

The Weekend Challenge To Do App is a lightweight note talking and organizing app. It was created for the Full Stack Engineering course at Prime Digital Academy. We were tasked to create a to do app in a weekend that would store our notes on a database and give the user a simple interface for interacting with them.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

To run the application on your local machine follow these steps:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/),
2. Create a database named `todo-app`,
3. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that is the software we used to create the queries, 
4. Open up your editor of choice and run `npm install`,
5. Run `npm start` in your terminal,
6. Open a browser window and go to `localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Create and store notes for yourself.
2. Organize your notes in containers.
3. Keep track of where your project is at.
